v0.03
created the purchase class that allows the player to upgrade their damage
To do:
Create a class for each purchase button that will include the price as well as the increase (make it outside the purchase class so it can be used in a window for increasing passive income.
Allow each button to have seperate odds and damage modifiers by making a class to extend the button class
